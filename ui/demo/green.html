        <p>Red is the color at the end of the spectrum of visible light next to orange and opposite violet.[3] It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly 620â€“740 nm. Red is one of the additive primary colors of light, along with green and blue, which in RGB color systems are combined to create all the colors on a computer monitor or television screen. It is also one of the subtractive primary colors, along with yellow and blue, of the RYB color space and traditional color wheel used by painters and artists.</p>
        <p>Reds can vary in shade from very light pink to very dark maroon or burgundy; and in hue from the bright orange-red scarlet or vermilion to the bluish-red crimson.</p>
